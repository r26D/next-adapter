ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to <br/><code>@r26d/next-adapter</code>


This was forked on May 17, 2022 - from version 4.0.5
Adapter document and server for Next.js projects using Expo modules.

This version updates NextJS and strips out the need for typescript when you just checkout
the package - since it isn't being shipped via npm


## To Update

1. Sync the project code into the ts_version
1. Update the package deps in package.json
1. cd tools && npm start
1. commit and push
